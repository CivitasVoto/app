/**
  * @dev The smart token controller is an upgradable part of the smart token that allows
  * more functionality as well as fixes for bugs/exploits.
  * Once it accepts ownership of the token, it becomes the token's sole controller
  * that can execute any of its functions.
  * 
  * To upgrade the controller, ownership must be transferred to a new controller, along with
  * any relevant data.
  * 
  * The smart token must be set on construction and cannot be changed afterwards.
  * Wrappers are provided (as opposed to a single 'execute' function) for each of the token's functions, for easier access.
  * 
  * Note that the controller can transfer token ownership to a new controller that
  * doesn't allow executing any function on the token, for a trustless solution.
  * Doing that will also remove the owner's ability to upgrade the controller.
